## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/moshe19909090/typesense-search-app.git](https://github.com/moshe19909090/typesense-search-app.git)
    cd typesense-search-app
    ```

2.  **Start Typesense using Docker:**
    Navigate into the `backend` directory and run the Docker command. This will start a Typesense instance accessible on port `8108`.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    docker run -p 8108:8108 -v$(pwd)/typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:0.25.1 \
      --data-dir /data --api-key=xyz --listen-port 8108 --enable-cors
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Index product data:**
    Run the indexing script to upload the sample `catalog.fixed.jsonl` data into your running Typesense instance. You should see logs confirming successful indexing.

    ```bash
    npm run index
    ```

5.  **Run the backend server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Express server, which provides the `/search` endpoint for the frontend.

---

## 💻 Running the Frontend

Once the backend and Typesense are running, you can start the React frontend:

1.  **Open a new terminal** and navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the React application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🔍 Search Behavior

* Typing in the search box triggers a **200ms debounce** for live, instant search results.
* **Tags** and **Collections** facets dynamically update based on the current search query, ensuring only relevant filters are displayed.
* You can **click on filter chips** to apply filters and use the **"Clear Filters"** option to reset your search.
